### API coverage gaps (from `docs/API-MAPPING.md`; ⚠️ = destructive, `--yes` gate required)

#### 🔴 P0 — daily-use endpoints

<!-- `get_results_for_run/{run_id}` is already covered by the existing `result list` CLI command.
     `add_result_for_case/{run_id}/{case_id}` is already covered by the existing `result add` CLI command. -->

(all P0 items shipped — see BACKLOG-ARCHIVE.md)

#### 🟡 P1 — common metadata & admin

(all P1 items shipped — see BACKLOG-ARCHIVE.md)

#### 🟢 P2 — admin & low-traffic endpoints

(all P2 items shipped — see BACKLOG-ARCHIVE.md)

## 🏗️ Architecture

- [ ] 🟡 ♻️ ARCH #1: Extract `HttpPipeline` seam — collapse `request<T>`/`requestText`/`requestMultipart`/`requestBinary` (`client-core.ts`) into one pipeline + four response-parser adapters; concentrate retry-eligibility matrix
- [ ] 🟢 ♻️ ARCH #2: Write-handler factory — collapse 10 `cli/handlers/*-write.ts` files (36 handlers, 732 LOC) into declarative specs over a `createWriteHandler({pathParams, schema, clientMethod, destructive?})` factory; identical 4-step dance (parseId × N → resolveBody → dry-run branch → client call) repeated per handler
- [ ] 🟡 ♻️ ARCH #3: Promote `ACTIONS` (`cli/metadata.ts`, 607 LOC) to single source of truth — generate `dispatch.ts` HANDLERS (175 LOC) and `cli/index.ts` HELP text from it; new actions today require 3+ edit sites (handler + dispatch + metadata + HELP), drift caught only by tests not types
- [ ] 🟡 ♻️ ARCH #4: `Endpoint` registry — colocate method/URL/payload-schema/response-schema per endpoint; generate `modules/*.ts` methods and CLI handlers as adapters (depends on #2 + #3)
- [ ] 🟢 ♻️ ARCH #5: Revisit thin `modules/*.ts` wrappers — `variables.ts` (27 LOC), `reports.ts` (17), `datasets.ts` (32), `tests.ts` (33): every method is `validateId` + `requestParsed`/`request`, zero orchestration; collapses naturally once #4 lands; standalone value low
- [ ] 🟢 ♻️ ARCH #6: Extract pure helpers (`validateId`/`validateEntryId`/`validatePaginationParams`/`buildEndpoint` at `client-core.ts:444-493`) into standalone modules — they don't read `this`; today every caller needs a `TestRailClientCore` reference; would also let `cli/ids.ts:parseId` reuse the rule instead of duplicating it
- [ ] 🟡 ♻️ ARCH #7: Eliminate hand-written 1517-line facade (`client.ts`) — 131 `async` wrapper methods forwarding to 18 modules; either deprecate flat surface in favor of namespaced (`client.projects.getProject`) or generate the facade from module signatures at build time; contradicts ARCHITECTURE.md §3.2 — reopen because JSDoc/types are no longer the load-bearing reason (modules carry the same)
- [ ] 🟢 ♻️ ARCH #8: Fix `scripts/generate-mapping.js` Phase 1 parser — detect `buildEndpoint(base, params)` call sites and replace CLI name-heuristic; today `docs/API-MAPPING.md` shows `—` for implemented endpoints (e.g. `get_cases`, `get_runs`, `result:list`, `shared-step:history`); add `@testrail` JSDoc tags + `apiEndpoint` field on `ActionSpec` per the doc's caveat; turn on CI drift gate
- [ ] 🟢 ♻️ ARCH #9: Harmonize `--soft`/`--dry-run` check order across destructive handlers — currently mixed: `milestone delete`/`project delete`/`configuration delete`/`configuration-group delete` keep canonical `parseId → --soft reject → --dry-run → --yes`; `plan delete*`/`variable delete`/`shared-step delete` use newer `parseId → --dry-run → --soft reject → --yes`. Functionally equivalent (no API call either way), stylistic only — pick one ordering and apply uniformly so future destructive handlers don't have to choose.
